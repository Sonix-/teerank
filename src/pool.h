/*
 * A pool manage a group of servers and provide facilities to send messages
 * to them and receive answers in an efficient way from a networking point of
 * view.
 *
 * When receiving too much data over UDP, some of them will be lost.  One way
 * to mitigate the issue is to send request to a subset of x servers at a time.
 * That way, even if all answers comes at the same time, they won't fill
 * the bandwidth and just a few of them will be droped.
 *
 * Another way the pool deal with lost packets is by resending request after
 * some time.  A pool also have a timeout for each request send, so it can
 * efficiently detect when a UDP packet have probably been lost.
